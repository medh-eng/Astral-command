# Sarvam AI — work log and handoff, 31 October 2026

**For:** Claude (Director)
**From:** Sarvam AI (agent)
**Batch:** 3.2 and 3.3 complete; 3.1 and 3.4 not done — reasons below.

Read this alongside `docs/agents/SARVAM.md` (▶ Batch 3) and
`docs/HANDOFF-2026-10-30-director.md`. The Commander remains final authority; nothing here is a
shipped feature. All three files are drafts sitting in `incoming/`, waiting for you to wire them in.

## Delivered

### 3.2 — Hindi review, batch 2 → `incoming/text/sanjaya-review-2.csv`

The 30 lines that were not in `incoming/text/sanjaya-review.csv`, reviewed for naturalness,
grammar, matras and nukta, verb agreement and meaning against the English. Columns are the same
as batch 1: `id`, `hindi_voice_text`, `note`.

**7 fixes, 22 unchanged, 1 held.** Longest line is 12 words, so every line still fits the
2–4 second read.

| id | was | now | why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `volley_turned_1` | टकरा के टूट गए | टकराकर टूट गए | the clipped Braj form reads as verse, awkward in one breath |
| `scan_1` | दिव्य-दृष्टि · छुपता | दिव्यदृष्टि · छिपता | hyphen dropped to match the glossary; standard spelling |
| `rotate_1` | घेरों पर सब कुछ दिख गया | घेरों का सब कुछ खुल गया | "exposed" is खुलना, not merely becoming visible |
| `shield_break_1` | जीत गया, पर ढाल टूट गई | वह जीत गया, पर ढाल चटक गई | "cracked" is चटकना; वह makes the subject clear heard once |
| `entranced_pass_1` | हर चलने वाला योद्धा | जो भी योद्धा चल सकता था, वह | the old line read as "every walking warrior" |
| `last_rounds_1` | चक्र बंद हो रहा है | चक्र सिकुड़ रहा है | बंद sounded like the wheel being switched off |
| `draw_1` | मैदान बराबर | मैदान बराबरी का रहा | how a drawn field is actually said |

**Held at the time of review:** `astra_vayavya_enemy_1` was left untouched because the Commander
had not yet ruled on it. He approved the rewrite on 31 October — the final text is in
`sanjaya-rewrites-2026-10-31.csv` (task 3.4), not in this review file.

Two lines worth your eye when you wire this in, though neither needed a change:

- `astra_sammohana_enemy_1` says *"दो चाल तक रुक गया"*. It is right only because the game uses
  **चाल** for a move. If you ever rename the round or the move, this line breaks with it.
- `dawn_1` and `dusk_1` use **पहर** for the hour. It is the better word and I kept it, but the
  interface strings say **पहर** too, so the two now agree. Worth keeping that agreement.

On your correction to batch 1: you were right, and the same ने + रोके हुए हैं construction does
not appear anywhere in this batch. Every compound verb here agrees with its subject.

### 3.3 — Interface strings, Hindi and Marathi → `incoming/i18n/strings.hi.json`, `strings.mr.json`

All **149** keys translated, including the new Daily variants. Both files:

- carry **every key from `strings.en.json`, in the same order**, with no additions — checked
  programmatically, not by eye;
- keep numbers, `+1`, `×2` and the `6 × 8` / `8 × 10` board sizes exactly as they are;
- hold the game terms in Devanagari, spelled one way throughout: सेनापति, महारथी, दिव्यदृष्टि,
  शतघ्नी, दुर्ग, चक्रव्यूह, पद्मव्यूह, मकर, पद्म, अग्नेयास्त्र, सम्मोहनास्त्र, वायव्यास्त्र,
  ब्रह्मास्त्र, शक्ति — and in Marathi सेनापती, महारथी, दिव्यदृष्टी, शतघ्नी, दुर्ग, शक्ती;
- contain no leftover Latin text (validated with a regex, not a skim);
- are UTF-8, two-space indented, and re-parsed after writing to prove they load.

**Glossary I used, so you can check me against it.** The pieces are चर / रथ / यंत्रिक / द्रष्टा /
धनुर्धर / अश्वरोही / महारथी / सेनापति, the trap is शतघ्नी and the fort is दुर्ग — the same words
Sanjaya already says. A **move** is चाल and a **round** is दाँव, so `battle.round` is दाँव. The
board is a **खाना** (Hindi) / **घर** (Marathi). The opponents are सैनिक / द्रोणाचार्य / शकुनि.

Two judgement calls you may want to overrule:

1. **`home.codex` — settled.** The Commander ruled for "Rules" on 31 October, so
   `docs/i18n/strings.en.json` now says `"Rules"`, and Hindi and Marathi already said **नियम**.
   All three agree. **One thing left to finish:** `js/game.js:800` still hardcodes the literal
   `Codex` on the in-battle rules button, and `vyuha-standalone.html` carries the same text.
   That is game code, not a string file, so I did not touch it — it needs your rename plus a
   standalone rebuild and the check suite.
2. `unit.5.role` is **द्रष्टा** (the seer) while the piece itself is **दिव्यदृष्टि**. Role and
   piece name differ in English too, so I mirrored that rather than flattening them.

## Not done, and why

### 3.1 — Re-record four lines: **not possible from here**

`start_abhimanyu_1`, `start_tutorial_1`, `lose_capture_1`, `trap_defused_1` need Bulbul
text-to-speech. I have no TTS tool and no API key in this session, and I will not ask for or
handle a credential. The corrected Hindi for all four is already in `incoming/text/sanjaya-review.csv`
(batch 1), so the command in your brief can be run as-is by whoever holds the key:

```bash
python3 tools/voice-gen.py \
  --ids start_abhimanyu_1,start_tutorial_1,lose_capture_1,trap_defused_1 \
  --lang hi --speaker rahul --pace 1.15
```

Same for the Marathi and English sets in tasks 3 and 4. **No audio file in this batch is new or
replaced** — nothing was synthesised, so nothing can be mistaken for a Commander-approved voice.

### 3.4 — The two flat lines: **approved, still not recorded**

**The Commander approved both of your proposed rewrites on 31 October.** The final Hinglish,
Hindi and English for `win_capture_2` and `astra_vayavya_enemy_1` are in
`incoming/text/sanjaya-rewrites-2026-10-31.csv`, in the same column shape as
`sanjaya-lines.csv` so they merge straight in.

What is still missing is the audio. Both lines need Bulbul and I have no TTS here, so the text
is settled and the recording is not — the same blocker as 3.1:

```bash
python3 tools/voice-gen.py --ids win_capture_2,astra_vayavya_enemy_1 \
  --lang both --speaker rahul --pace 1.15
```

## What you need to do

1. Apply the seven fixes from `sanjaya-review-2.csv` to `js/sanjaya.js`, then regenerate the
   voice script (`tools/` — the CSV that feeds `voice-gen.py`).
2. Add the language switch and load `strings.hi.json` / `strings.mr.json`. **Nothing reads these
   files yet** — they are drafts in `incoming/`, and the roadmap item stays unticked until the
   switch is wired and playable.
3. Finish the "Codex" → "Rules" rename in `js/game.js:800` and rebuild the standalone. The
   string files are already consistent across all three languages.
4. Run 3.1 and 3.4 once the Commander has the key and has ruled on the two rewrites.

## Checks I ran

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `strings.hi.json` keys vs `strings.en.json` | 149/149 present, same order, no extras |
| `strings.mr.json` keys vs `strings.en.json` | 149/149 present, same order, no extras |
| Leftover Latin text in either file | none |
| JSON re-parse after write | both load, UTF-8 |
| `sanjaya-review-2.csv` rows | 30, matching the 30 ids not in batch 1 |
| Line length | max 12 words, all under the 14-word bar |
| CSV re-parse | 30 rows, 3 columns, quoting matches batch 1 |

**Not checked, and I am not claiming it:** no native Marathi speaker has read `strings.mr.json`.
I am a model, not a Maharashtrian reader, and the Marathi is mine, not a reviewer's. It is worth
one pass from a person before it ships — the same standard the Commander set for the Hindi voice.
